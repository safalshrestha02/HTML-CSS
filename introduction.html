    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <p>
      At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied
      to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a
      paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a
      document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of
      content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos
      into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and
      introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand
      HTML.
    </p>
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
      Before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge,
      but you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and
      using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content).
      You should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in Installing
      basic software), and understand how to create and manage files (as
      detailed in Dealing with files). Both are parts of our Getting started
      with the web complete beginner's module
    </p>
    <h2>Guides</h2>
    <p>
      This module contains the following articles, which will take you through
      all the basic theory of HTML and provide ample opportunity for you to test
      out some skills.

      Covers the absolute basics of HTML, to get you started — we define
      elements, attributes, and other important terms, and show where they fit
      in the language. We also show how a typical HTML page is structured and
      how an HTML element is structured, and explain other important basic
      language features. Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you
      interested!

    </h3>
    <p>
      The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web
      browser when the page is loaded. It contains information such as the page
      &lt;title&gt;, links to CSS (if you want to style your HTML content with
      CSS), links to custom favicons, and metadata (data about the HTML, such as
      who wrote it, and important keywords that describe the document).

      >
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of HTML's main jobs is to give text meaning (also known as semantics),
      so that the browser knows how to display it correctly. This article looks
      at how to use HTML to break up a block of text into a structure of
      headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words, create lists,
      and more.

      >
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hyperlinks are really important — they are what makes the web a web. This
      article shows the syntax required to make a link and discusses best
      practices for links.

    </h3>
    <p>
      There are many other elements in HTML for formatting text that we didn't
      get to in the HTML text fundamentals article. The elements here are less
      well-known, but still useful to know about. In this article, you'll learn
      about marking up quotations, description lists, computer code and other
      related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and more.

    </h3>
    <p>
      As well as defining individual parts of your page (such as "a paragraph"
      or "an image"), HTML is also used to define areas of your website (such as
      "the header", "the navigation menu", or "the main content column"). This
      article looks into how to plan a basic website structure and how to write
      the HTML to represent this structure.

      Writing HTML is fine, but what if something goes wrong, and you can't work
      out where the error in the code is? This article will introduce you to
      some tools that can help.
