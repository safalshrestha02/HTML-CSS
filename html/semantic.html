      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        As we all know HTML is a language of the web. It’s used to design the
        web pages or we can say structure the page layouts of a website. HTML
        stands for HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE, as its full form suggests it’s not
        any programming language, a markup language. So, while the execution of
        HTML code we can’t face any such error. In real HTML code wasn’t
        compiled or interpreted because HTML code was rendered by the browser.
        which is similar to the compilation of a program. Html content is
        parched through the browser to display the content of HTML.
      </p>
      <h2>HTML document structure</h2>
      <p>
        Html used predefined tags and attributes to tell the browser how to
        display content, means in which format, style, font size, and images to
        display. Html is a case insensitive language. Case insensitive means
        there is no difference in upper case and lower case ( capital and small
        letters) both treated as the same, for r example ‘D’ and ‘d’ both are
        the same here. There are generally two types of tags in HTML:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Paired Tags: These tags come in pairs. That is they have both
          opening(&lt; &gt) and closing(&lt;/ &gt) tags.
        </li>
        <li>Empty Tags: These tags do not require to be closed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Below is an example of a &lt;b&gt; tag in HTML, which tells the browser
        to bold the text inside it.

      Tags and attributes: Tags are individuals of html structure, we have to
      open and close any tag with a forward slash like this
      &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;. There are some variations with the tag some of them
      are self-closing tag which isn’t required to close and some are empty tag
      where we can add any attributes in it. Attributes are additional
      properties of html tags that define the property of any html tags. i.e.
      width, height, controls, loops, input, and autoplay. These attributes also
      help us to store information in meta tags by using name, content, and type
      attributes. Html documents structured mentioned below:

      <h2>Structure of an HTML Document</h2>
      <p>An HTML Document is mainly divided into two parts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          HEAD: This contains the information about the HTML document. For
          Example, the Title of the page, version of HTML, Meta Data, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          BODY: This contains everything you want to display on the Web Page.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <img
        src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1102860047312224257/1179662457191530646/image.png?ex=657a9946&is=65682446&hm=a377585971cb2e007f338dea88c0b996800dbdca66aa65a37b4da3d8ea83333b&"

      <h2>HTML Tags</h2>
      <p>
        HTML tags are the keywords that are used to produce web pages in various
        formats. Opening tags and closing tags are found in the majority of
        tags. The concluding tags contain a forward slash (/), while the
        language of the beginning tags is the same. Certain tags don’t need to
        be closed. Refer to this
        <a
          href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-tags-a-to-z-list/"

      <h2>Semantics</h2>
      <p>
        A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and
        the developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some examples of semantic tags are:
        <code>
          &lt;form&gt;, &lt;table&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;,
          &lt;main&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;
        </code>
        , etc tag.
      </p>
