      <h1>ARIA roles and attributes for accessibility</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of roles and
          attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications
          (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people
          with disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          It supplements HTML so that interactions and widgets commonly used in
          applications can be passed to assistive technologies when there is not
          otherwise a mechanism. For example, ARIA enables accessible JavaScript
          widgets, form hints and error messages, live content updates, and
          more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first rule of ARIA use is "If you can use a native HTML element or
          attribute with the semantics and behavior you require already built
          in, instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state
          or property to make it accessible, then do so."
        </p>

        <h2>Support</h2>
        <p>
          Like any other web technology, there are varying degrees of support
          for ARIA. Support is based on the operating system and browser being
          used, as well as the kind of assistive technology interfacing with it.
          In addition, the version of the operating system, browser, and
          assistive technology are contributing factors. Older software versions
          may not support certain ARIA roles, have only partial support, or
          misreport its functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also important to acknowledge that some people who rely on
          assistive technology are reluctant to upgrade their software, for fear
          of losing the ability to interact with their computer and browser.
          Because of this, it is important to use semantic HTML elements
          whenever possible, as semantic HTML has far better support for
          assistive technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also important to test your authored ARIA with actual assistive
          technology. This is because browser emulators and simulators are not
          really effective for testing full support. Similarly, proxy assistive
          technology solutions are not sufficient to fully guarantee
          functionality.

        <h2>ARIA Roles</h2>
        <p>
          ARIA roles provide semantic meaning to content, allowing screen
          readers and other tools to present and support interaction with an
          object in a way that is consistent with user expectations of that type
          of object. ARIA roles can be used to describe elements that don't
          natively exist in HTML or exist but don't yet have full browser
          support.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default, many semantic elements in HTML have a role; for example,
          &lt;input type="radio"&gt; has the "radio" role. Non-semantic elements
          in HTML do not have a role; &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; without added
          semantics return null. The role attribute can provide semantics.
        </p>
        <p>
          ARIA roles are added to HTML elements using role="role type", where
          role type is the name of a role in the ARIA specification. Some roles
          require the inclusion of associated ARIA states or properties; others
          are only valid in association with other roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, &lt;ul role="tabpanel"&gt; will be announced as a 'tab
          panel' by screen readers. However, if the tab panel doesn't have
          nested tabs, the element with the tabpanel role is not in fact a tab
          panel and accessibility has actually been negatively impacted. The
          ARIA states and properties associated with each role are included in
          the role's pages, with each attribute also having a dedicated page.
        </p>

        <h2>ARIA role types</h2>
        <p>There are 6 categories of ARIA roles:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Document structure roles</li>
          <p>
            Document Structure roles are used to provide a structural
            description for a section of content. Most of these roles should no
            longer be used as browsers now support semantic HTML element with
            the same meaning. The roles without HTML equivalents, such as
            presentation, toolbar and tooltip roles, provide information on the
            document structure to assistive technologies such as screen readers
            as equivalent native HTML tags are not available.
          </p>
          <li>Widget roles</li>
          <p>
            The various widget role are used to define common interactive
            patterns. Similar to the document structure roles, some of these
            roles duplicate the semantics of native HTML elements that are well
            supported, and should not be used. The difference between the two
            lists is that, generally, the widget roles require JavaScript
            interaction and the document structure roles don't necessarily.
          </p>
          <li>Landmark roles</li>
          <p>
            Landmark roles provide a way to identify the organization and
            structure of a web page. By classifying and labeling sections of a
            page, structural information conveyed visually through layout is
            represented programmatically. Screen readers use landmark roles to
            provide keyboard navigation to important sections of a page. Use
            these sparingly. Too many landmark roles create "noise" in screen
            readers, making it difficult to understand the overall layout of the
            page.
          </p>
          <li>Live region roles</li>
          <p>
            Live Region roles are used to define elements with content that will
            be dynamically changed. Sighted users can see dynamic changes when
            they are visually noticeable. These roles help low vision and blind
            users know if content has been updated. Assistive technologies, like
            screen readers, can be made to announce dynamic content changes:
          </p>
          <li>Window roles</li>
          <p>
            Window roles define sub-windows to the main document window, within
            the same window, such as pop up modal dialogs.
          </p>
          <li>Abstract roles</li>
          <p>
            Abstract roles are only intended for use by browsers to help
            organize and streamline a document. They should not be used by
            developers writing HTML markup. Doing so will not result in any
            meaningful information being conveyed to assistive technologies or
            to users.

        <h2>ARIA states and properties</h2>
        <p>
          ARIA attributes enable modifying an element's states and properties as
          defined in the accessibility tree.
        </p>
        <h3>ARIA attribute types</h3>
        <p>There are 4 categories of ARIA states and properties:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Widget attributes</li>
          <li>Live region attributes</li>
          <li>Drag-and-Drop attributes</li>
          <li>Relationship attributes</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Global ARIA attributes</h3>
        <p>
          Some states and properties apply to all HTML elements regardless of
          whether an ARIA role is applied. These are defined as "Global"
          attributes. Global states and properties are supported by all roles
          and base markup elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of the above attributes are global, meaning they can be included
          on any element unless specifically disallowed
