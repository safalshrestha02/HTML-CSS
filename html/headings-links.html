      <h1>HTML text fundamentals</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure so that a browser
          can display an
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML"
            target="_blank"
            >HTML</a
          >
          document the way its developer intends. This article explains the way
          HTML can be used to structure a page of text by adding headings and
          paragraphs, emphasizing words, creating lists, and more
        </p>
        <h2>The basics: headings and paragraphs</h2>
        <p>
          Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you
          are reading a story, a newspaper, a college textbook, a magazine, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more
          enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
          In HTML, each paragraph has to be wrapped in a &lt;p&gt; element, like
          so: <br />
          <span><code>&lt;p&gt;I am a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code></span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Each heading has to be wrapped in a heading element: <br />
          <span><code>&lt;h1&gt;Title for something&lt;/h1&gt;</code></span>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are six heading elements: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. Each
          element represents a different level of content in the document;
          &lt;h1&gt; represents the main heading, &lt;h2&gt; represents
          subheadings, &lt;h3&gt; represents sub-subheadings, and so on.
        </p>
        <h2>Implementing structural hierarchy</h2>
        <p>
          For example, in this story, the &lt;h1&gt; element represents the
          title of the story, the &lt;h2&gt; elements represent the title of
          each chapter, and the &lt;h3&gt; elements represent sub-sections of
          each chapter:
        </p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>
          Now let's turn our attention to lists. Lists are everywhere in
          life—from your shopping list to the list of directions you
          subconsciously follow to get to your house every day, to the lists of
          instructions you are following in these tutorials! Lists are
          everywhere on the web, too, and we've got three different types to
          worry about.
        </p>
        <h3>Unordered</h3>
        <p>
          Unordered lists are used to mark up lists of items for which the order
          of the items doesn't matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every unordered list starts off with a &lt;ul&gt; element—this wraps
          around all the list items and the last step is to wrap each list item
          in a &lt;li&gt; (list item) element:
        </p>
        <div class="code-base">
          <code>
            &lt;ul&gt; <br />
            &ensp; &lt;li&gt;milk&lt;/li&gt; <br />
            &ensp; &lt;li&gt;eggs&lt;/li&gt; <br />
            &ensp; &lt;li&gt;bread&lt;/li&gt; <br />
            &ensp; &lt;li&gt;hummus&lt;/li&gt; <br />
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          </code>
        </div>
        <div class="code-example">
          <ul class="example">
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>eggs</li>
            <li>bread</li>
            <li>hummus</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Ordered</h3>
        <p>
          Ordered lists are lists in which the order of the items does matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The markup structure is the same as for unordered lists, except that
          you have to wrap the list items in an &lt;ol&gt; element, rather than
          &lt;ul&gt;:
        </p>
        <div class="code-base">
          <code>
            &lt;ol&gt; <br />
            &ensp; &lt;li&gt;Drive to the end of the road&lt;/li&gt; <br />
            &ensp; &lt;li&gt;Turn right&lt;/li&gt; <br />
            &ensp; &lt;li&gt;Go straight across the first two
            roundabouts&lt;/li&gt;
            <br />
            &ensp; &lt;li&gt;Turn left at the third roundabout&lt;/li&gt; <br />
            &ensp; &lt;li&gt;The school is on your right, 300 meters up the
            road&lt;/li&gt; <br />
            &lt;/ol&gt;
          </code>
        </div>
        <div class="code-example">
          <ol class="example">
            <li>Drive to the end of the road</li>
            <li>Turn right</li>
            <li>Go straight across the first two roundabouts</li>
            <li>Turn left at the third roundabout</li>
            <li>The school is on your right, 300 meters up the road</li>
          </ol>

        <h2>Creating hyperlinks</h2>
        <p>
          Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to
          offer. They've been a feature of the Web since the beginning, and are
          what makes the Web a web. Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to
          other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or
          make apps available at a web address. Almost any web content can be
          converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise activated the
          web browser goes to another web address (URL).
        </p>
        <h3>Anatomy of a link</h3>
        <p>
          A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside
          an &lt;a&gt; element and using the <code>href</code> attribute, also
          known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web
          address.
        </p>
        <div class="code-base">
          <code>
            &lt;p&gt; <br />
            &ensp;I'm creating a link to &lt;a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/"&gt;MDN web
            docs&lt;/a&gt;.
            <br />
            &lt;/p&gt;
          </code>
        </div>
        <div class="code-example">
          <p class="example">
            I'm creating a link to
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank"
              >MDN web docs.
            </a>
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Absolute versus relative URLs</h3>
        <p>
          Two terms you'll come across on the Web are absolute URL and relative
          URL:
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Absolute URL:</b> Points to a location defined by its absolute
          location on the web, including protocol and domain name. For example,
          if an <code>index.html</code> page is uploaded to a directory called
          projects that sits inside the root of a web server, and the website's
          domain is <code>https://www.example.com</code>, the page would be
          available at
          <code>https://www.example.com/projects/index.html</code> (or even just
          <code>https://www.example.com/projects/</code>, as most web servers
          just look for a landing page such as <code>index.html</code> to load
          if it isn't specified in the URL.)
        </p>
        <p>
          An absolute URL will always point to the same location, no matter
          where it's used.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Relative URL:</b> Points to a location that is relative to the file
          you are linking from, more like what we looked at in the previous
          section. For example, if we wanted to link from our example file at
          <code>https://www.example.com/projects/index.html</code> to a PDF file
          in the same directory, the URL would just be the filename —
          <code>project-brief.pdf</code> — no extra information needed. If the
          PDF was available in a subdirectory inside projects called pdfs, the
          relative link would be <code>pdfs/project-brief.pdf</code> (the
          equivalent absolute URL would be
          <code>https://www.example.com/projects/pdfs/project-brief.pdf</code>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          A relative URL will point to different places depending on the actual
          location of the file you refer from — for example if we moved our
          <code>index.html</code> file out of the projects directory and into
          the root of the website (the top level, not in any directories), the
          <code>pdfs/project-brief.pdf</code> relative URL link inside it would
          now point to a file located at
          <code>https://www.example.com/pdfs/project-brief.pdf</code>, not a
          file located at
          <code>https://www.example.com/projects/pdfs/project-brief.pdf</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, the location of the <code>project-brief.pdf</code> file and
          pdfs folder won't suddenly change because you moved the
          <code>index.html</code> file — this would make your link point to the
          wrong place, so it wouldn't work if clicked on. You need to be
          careful!
        </p>
