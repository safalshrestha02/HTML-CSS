        <h2>HTML: A good basis for accessibility</h2>
        <p>
          A great deal of web content can be made accessible just by making sure
          the correct Hypertext Markup Language elements are used for the
          correct purpose at all times. This article looks in detail at how HTML
          can be used to ensure maximum accessibility.
        </p>
        <h3>HTML and accessibility</h3>
        <p>
          As you learn more about HTML — read more resources, look at more
          examples, etc. — you'll keep seeing a common theme: the importance of
          using semantic HTML (sometimes called POSH, or Plain Old Semantic
          HTML). This means using the correct HTML elements for their intended
          purpose as much as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might wonder why this is so important. After all, you can use a
          combination of CSS and JavaScript to make just about any HTML element
          behave in whatever way you want. For example, a control button to play
          a video on your site could be marked up like this:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <div class="code-base">
            <code> &lt;div&gt;Play video&lt;/div&gt; </code>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          But as you'll see in greater detail later on, it makes sense to use
          the correct element for the job:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <div class="code-base">
            <code> &lt;button&gt;Play video&lt;/button&gt; </code>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Not only do HTML &lt;button&gt;s have some suitable styling applied by
          default (which you will probably want to override), they also have
          built-in keyboard accessibility — users can navigate between buttons
          using the Tab key and activate their selection using Space, Return or
          Enter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Semantic HTML doesn't take any longer to write than non-semantic (bad)
          markup if you do it consistently from the start of your project. Even
          better, semantic markup has other benefits beyond accessibility:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Easier to develop with — as mentioned above, you get some
            functionality for free, plus it is arguably easier to understand.
          </li>
          <li>
            Better on mobile — semantic HTML is arguably lighter in file size
            than non-semantic spaghetti code, and easier to make responsive.
          </li>
          <li>
            Good for SEO — search engines give more importance to keywords
            inside headings, links, etc. than keywords included in non-semantic
            &lt;div&gt;s, etc., so your documents will be more findable by
            customers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Good semantics</h2>
        <p>
          We've already talked about the importance of proper semantics, and why
          we should use the right HTML element for the job. This cannot be
          ignored, as it is one of the main places that accessibility is badly
          broken if not handled properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out there on the web, the truth is that people do some very strange
          things with HTML markup. Some abuses of HTML are due to legacy
          practices that have not been completely forgotten, and some are just
          plain ignorance. Whatever the case, you should replace such bad code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes you are not in the position to get rid of lousy markup —
          your pages might be generated by some kind of server-side framework
          over which you don't have full control, or you might have third party
          content on your page (such as ad banners) over which you have no
          control. The goal isn't "all or nothing"; every improvement you can
          make will help the cause of accessibility.
        </p>
        <h3>Text content</h3>
        <p>
          One of the best accessibility aids a screen reader user can have is an
          excellent content structure with headings, paragraphs, lists, etc. An
          excellent semantic example might look something like the following:
        </p>
        <div class="code-base">
          <code>
            &lt;h1&gt; My heading&lt;/h1&gt; <br />

            &lt;p&gt; This is the first section of my document.&lt;/p&gt; <br />

            &lt;p&gt; I'll add another paragraph here too.&lt;/p&gt; <br />

            &lt;ol&gt; <br />
            &lt;li&gt; Here is&lt;/li&gt; <br />
            &lt;li&gt; a list for&lt;/li&gt; <br />
            &lt;li&gt; you to read&lt;/li&gt; <br />
            &lt;/ol&gt; <br />

            &lt;h2&gt; My subheading&lt;/h2&gt; <br />

            &lt;p&gt; <br />
            This is the first subsection of my document. I'd love people to be
            able to find this content! &lt;/p&gt; <br />

            &lt;h2&gt; My 2nd subheading&lt;/h2&gt; <br />

            &lt;p&gt; <br />
            This is the second subsection of my content, which I think is more
            interesting than the last one. &lt;/p&gt; <br />
          </code>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
          <div class="code-example">
            <h1>My heading</h1>

            <p>This is the first section of my document.</p>

            <p>I'll add another paragraph here too.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Here is</li>
              <li>a list for</li>
              <li>you to read</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>My subheading</h2>

            <p>
              This is the first subsection of my document. I'd love people to be
              able to find this content!
            </p>

            <h2>My 2nd subheading</h2>

            <p>
              This is the second subsection of my content, which I think is more
              interesting than the last one.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Using clear language</h3>
        <p>
          The language you use can also affect accessibility. In general, you
          should use clear language that is not overly complex and doesn't use
          unnecessary jargon or slang terms. This not only benefits people with
          cognitive or other disabilities; it benefits readers for whom the text
          is not written in their first language, younger people…, everyone, in
          fact! Apart from this, you should try to avoid using language and
          characters that don't get read out clearly by the screen reader. For
          example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Don't use dashes if you can avoid it. Instead of writing 5–7, write
            5 to 7.
          </li>
          <li>Expand abbreviations — instead of writing Jan, write January.</li>
          <li>
            Expand acronyms, at least once or twice, then use the &lt;abbr&gt;
            tag to describe them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Page layouts</h3>
        <p>
          In the bad old days, people used to create page layouts using HTML
          tables — using different table cells to contain the header, footer,
          sidebar, main content column, etc. This is not a good idea because a
          screen reader will likely give out confusing readouts, especially if
          the layout is complex and has many nested tables.
        </p>

        <h3>UI controls</h3>
        <p>
          By UI controls, we mean the main parts of web documents that users
          interact with — most commonly buttons, links, and form controls. In
          this section, we'll look at the basic accessibility concerns to be
          aware of when creating such controls. Later articles on WAI-ARIA and
          multimedia will look at other aspects of UI accessibility.
