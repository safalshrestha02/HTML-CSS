      <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be
        applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document
        (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?),
        structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three
        columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as
        images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two
        of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know
        to understand HTML.
      </p>
      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
      <p>
        Before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge,
        but you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and
        using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming
        content). You should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed
        in Installing basic software), and understand how to create and manage
        files (as detailed in Dealing with files). Both are parts of our Getting
        started with the web complete beginner's module
      </p>
      <h2>Guides</h2>
      <p>
        This module contains the following articles, which will take you through
        all the basic theory of HTML and provide ample opportunity for you to
        test out some skills.

        Covers the absolute basics of HTML, to get you started — we define
        elements, attributes, and other important terms, and show where they fit
        in the language. We also show how a typical HTML page is structured and
        how an HTML element is structured, and explain other important basic
        language features. Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you
        interested!

      <p>
        The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the
        web browser when the page is loaded. It contains information such as the
        page &lt;title&gt;, links to CSS (if you want to style your HTML content
        with CSS), links to custom favicons, and metadata (data about the HTML,
        such as who wrote it, and important keywords that describe the
        document).

        One of HTML's main jobs is to give text meaning (also known as
        semantics), so that the browser knows how to display it correctly. This
        article looks at how to use HTML to break up a block of text into a
        structure of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words,
        create lists, and more.

        There are many other elements in HTML for formatting text that we didn't
        get to in the HTML text fundamentals article. The elements here are less
        well-known, but still useful to know about. In this article, you'll
        learn about marking up quotations, description lists, computer code and
        other related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and
        more.

      <p>
        As well as defining individual parts of your page (such as "a paragraph"
        or "an image"), HTML is also used to define areas of your website (such
        as "the header", "the navigation menu", or "the main content column").
        This article looks into how to plan a basic website structure and how to
        write the HTML to represent this structure.
